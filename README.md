# GitHub-Actions Continuous Deployment (CD)
### [Part 2 of the project of the week from DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2023-02-08-github_actions-2.md)

Continuous Deployment is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. It allows teams to release changes quickly and with confidence, improving the speed and efficiency of the development process.

Continuous Deployment using GitHub Actions involves the following steps:

- Create a new workflow file in your GitHub repository's .github/workflows directory. The workflow file should specify the steps that need to be taken for Continuous Deployment.
- Configure the steps in your workflow to build, test, and deploy your code. This may involve setting up environment variables, checking out your code, and running scripts.
- Push your code changes to your GitHub repository to trigger the workflow.
- Monitor the progress of your workflow from the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.
- Optionally, you can set up notifications for successful or failed deployments by using the GitHub Actions API and webhooks.
