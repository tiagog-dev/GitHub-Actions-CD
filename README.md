# GitHub-Actions Continuous Deployment (CD)
Part 2 of the project of the week from DataTalksClub

Continuous Deployment is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. It allows teams to release changes quickly and with confidence, improving the speed and efficiency of the development process.
